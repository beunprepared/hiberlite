= Introduction =

In this tutorial we will create an sqlite datababase, put user object in it and then try to read that object back.


= Source code  =

Complete and working [http://code.google.com/p/hiberlite/source/browse/trunk/sample.cpp source code] for this tutorial is available in the svn repository.

= Usage =
  * Download and install the library.
  * In your code include the main header
{{{
#include "hiberlite.h"
}}}
  * Add the "-lhiberlite" flag to your linker options.
  * You will also need "-lsqlite3" .

= User-defined class =

First we define the classes we plan to store in the database:

{{{
class MyClass{
        friend class hiberlite::access;
        template<class Archive>
        void hibernate(Archive & ar)
        {
                ar & HIBERLITE_NVP(a);
                ar & HIBERLITE_NVP(b);
                ar & HIBERLITE_NVP(vs);
        }
public:
        int a;
        double b;
        vector<string> vs;
};
HIBERLITE_EXPORT_CLASS(MyClass)
}}}


Note the _friend_ declaration and the _hibernate(...)_ template method - these two pieces of code are necessary for hiberlite to access the internal structure of the user-defined class.

*HIBERLITE_NVP* is a macro that creates a name-value pair with reference to its argument.

*HIBERLITE_EXPORT_CLASS()* is a macro that serves similar purpose to BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT. For now just use this macro for each your class containing _hibernate()_ method.

= Creating a database =
We create a database file and some tables in it with
{{{
       hiberlite::Database db("sample.db");
       db.registerBeanClass<MyClass>();
       db.dropModel();
       db.createModel();
}}}
Every instance of the [Database] class has its own schema. _registerBeanClass<MyClass>()_ template method adds tables, needed to store MyClass objects to that model.
