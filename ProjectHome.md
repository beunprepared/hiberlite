Sep9 - hiberlite v0.7 released!

## hiberlite ##

C++ object-relational mapping with API inspired by the Boost.Serialization - that means almost no API to learn.

In contrast to most serialization libraries with SQL serializers, C++ objects mapped with hiberlite behave similar to [active record pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record) - you are not forced to follow the "read all your data/modify some small part/write everything back" path.

For people who need reliable data storage, ACID transactions, simple random-access to their data files, and don't like coding in SQL.

For the quick introduction read the [tutorial](http://code.google.com/p/hiberlite/wiki/Tutorial).
